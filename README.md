To use the video call, an account has to be created on getstream.io, an api key will be generated, copy the api key and replace it with the one in the code when the developer open .env file.

All other technologies including their version and libraries can be found in the package.json file.

To start the app, you have to download Expo Go from playstore on your android phone.
locate the api folder by following this location, store > api > index.js, in the index.js, change the ip address to the system's ip address, (you can get the system IP address by opening your command prompt, and type "ipconfig", then press enter.), copy the ip address and replace it with the one in the index.js.
On the IDE terminal run, run this command.

Developer should know about expo-dev-client very well, it's quiet different from ordinary expo.
